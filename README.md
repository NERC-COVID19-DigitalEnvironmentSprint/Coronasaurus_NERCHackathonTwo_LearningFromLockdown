This repository is coronasaurus's entry to NERC's [COVID-19 Hackathon 2: Recovery](https://digitalenvironment.org/home/covid-19-digital-sprint-hackathons/covid-19-hackathon-2-recovery/).

## Introduction
The unprecedented global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in huge population behavioural changes; from the cessation of travel to a transition to remote working. We don't often see changes of this magnitude, which offers researchers the unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of lockdown measures.

One particular area of interest is the impact on greenhouse gas emissions. As a signatory of the Paris Agreement the UK has a responsibility to limit the global average temperature rise to below 2&deg;C, but this is an ambitious task! Can we use data from this event to evaluate the sort of changes that might need to be made to meet these climate goals?

## The brief
[![alt text](https://i2.wp.com/digitalenvironment.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/covid-19_banner-800.png?w=800&ssl=1)](https://digitalenvironment.org/home/covid-19-digital-sprint-hackathons/)

This is an entry for [COVID-19 Hackathon 2: Recovery](https://digitalenvironment.org/home/covid-19-digital-sprint-hackathons/covid-19-hackathon-2-recovery/), run by the Natural Environment Research Council on behalf of UKRI. The brief is:

> - What are the positive and negative aspects of lockdown and recovery measures on meeting Paris and net zero targets?
> - Using multivariate signals to highlight these impacts and their inter-relationships to inform decision making.
>
> Multivariate signals and their interrelationships can be used to highlight the path to recovery. The pandemic is essentially a large unplanned experiment, allowing us to consider the ex-ante/mid-post/ex-post aspects of the effectiveness of the lockdown measures. It further allows us to study the positive and negative aspects of lockdown behaviours and to differentiate between the two. It can also help us to better understand the challenges associated with reaching the 8% target of the Paris Accord and reaching net zero (lockdown restrictions have currently delivered both a 5% reduction in emissions, and a 14% reduction in GDP). Solutions addressing this theme can draw from a variety of data sources including EO, social media and other potential sources.

## Our Approach
We need to build a narrative here.
