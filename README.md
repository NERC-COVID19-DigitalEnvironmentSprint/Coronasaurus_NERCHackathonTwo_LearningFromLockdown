## Introduction
The unprecedented global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in huge population behavioural changes; from the cessation of travel to a transition to remote working. We don't often see changes of this magnitude, which offers researchers the unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of lockdown measures.

One particular area of interest is the impact on greenhouse gas emissions. As a signatory of the Paris Agreement the UK has a responsibility to limit the global average temperature rise to below 2&deg;C, but this is an ambitious task! Can we use data from this event to evaluate the sort of changes that might need to be made to meet these climate goals?

## The brief

This is an entry for [COVID-19 Hackathon 2: Recovery](https://digitalenvironment.org/home/covid-19-digital-sprint-hackathons/covid-19-hackathon-2-recovery/), run by the Natural Environment Research Council on behalf of UKRI. The brief is:

> - What are the positive and negative aspects of lockdown and recovery measures on meeting Paris and net zero targets?
> - Using multivariate signals to highlight these impacts and their inter-relationships to inform decision making.
>
> Multivariate signals and their interrelationships can be used to highlight the path to recovery. The pandemic is essentially a large unplanned experiment, allowing us to consider the ex-ante/mid-post/ex-post aspects of the effectiveness of the lockdown measures. It further allows us to study the positive and negative aspects of lockdown behaviours and to differentiate between the two. It can also help us to better understand the challenges associated with reaching the 8% target of the Paris Accord and reaching net zero (lockdown restrictions have currently delivered both a 5% reduction in emissions, and a 14% reduction in GDP). Solutions addressing this theme can draw from a variety of data sources including EO, social media and other potential sources.

## Our Approach
### Overview
Despite all the myriad of words, discussions, research and arguments, the Paris Climate Accord has a simple fundamental aim to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide to a level that will limit global temperature rise.

However, the potential solutions are numerous, highly interconnected and far from simple to implement and achieve. Team Coronasaurus has therefore concentrated on just one strand of a potential solution based upon the real-world experience of the 2020 Covid 19 UK lockdown (March 2020 – to date).

There is not a single household or workplace that the Covid 19 Lockdown did not have an impact upon. Team Coronasaurus examined the effects of the lockdown, seen through publicly available data, to examine how reducing and changing work patterns to incorporate more remote working could contribute towards long term carbon dioxide reduction.

### The data story
In the period following lockdown on 22 March, well over half of the UK’s workforce remained at home either having been placed on the governments furlough scheme, working remotely from home, having been made redundant or by some other method. This change to the workforce was examined through a proxy measures of transport, energy generation, energy consumption, energy costs and atmospheric emissions. Prior to lockdown, normal life was being conducted and after lockdown, life was limited to staying at home and only going out for essential reasons with the exception of a proportion of the population that continued to work in their place of work.
